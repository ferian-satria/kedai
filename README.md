Simple Groceries App
This is my first project after learning the basics of the dart language, I used a lot of external assets that I put into the code.
The criteria for this project are:

Implementation using Stateless Widget and Stateful Widget. The widget/input displays the light/dark mode of the application.
Implementation using Navigation.
